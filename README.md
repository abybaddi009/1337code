### Preface
This repository contains Python solutions to the problems provided in the following medium [article](https://medium.com/@koheiarai94/60-leetcode-questions-to-prepare-for-coding-interview-8abbb6af589e).

I wanted to land a job offer from one of 1337. Here are some problems I assume will help me pass the coding interview.

Categories are

    - [Preface](#preface)
      - [LinkedList](#linkedlist)
      - [Stack](#stack)
      - [Heap, PriorityQueue](#heap-priorityqueue)
      - [HashMap](#hashmap)
      - [Graph, BFS, DFS](#graph-bfs-dfs)
      - [Tree, BT, BST](#tree-bt-bst)
      - [Sort](#sort)
      - [Dynamic Programming](#dynamic-programming)
      - [Binary Search](#binary-search)
      - [Recursion](#recursion)
      - [Sliding Window](#sliding-window)
      - [Greedy + Backtracking](#greedy--backtracking)
      - [Others](#others)

If you can solve them quickly, you would have a high chance to pass coding interview. Problems are either Easy or Medium. I put these questions in [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y98QKaYPazWImEt1nA_ocpGNJ-yQjH1FAsVQhUQ7OTw/edit?usp=sharing). Feel free to copy and paste to keep track of the progress.

These problems are also available on [LeetCode List](https://leetcode.com/list/xo2bgr0r/). You can clone to your account to avoid solving problems you have already solved.
